# Everything in one command: start a Muse video job, wait for it, download the .mp4. Prints the saved path.
# Usage: video.sh "<prompt>" [key=value ...]     (options as in generate.sh: image_1..9, video_1..3, audio_1..3)
# Example: video.sh "Animate image_1: she turns to the camera and says: \"Best seat in town.\" Keep her face exactly as in image_1." \
#            image_1=<assetId>
# OUT_DIR sets the folder (default: the current one); the final job record is saved next to it as .json,
# with the new file's assetId in .result.assets[0].assetId for the next job.
# If the run is interrupted after "job ..." was logged, do NOT run it again (that uses the allowance twice). Resume with:
#   wait-job.sh <jobid> > job.json && download.sh job.json
